Analysis Summary

The purpose of this analysis is to look at the success of different schools based on school budget, size, and type (district or charter). The success of these schools is determined based on two variables, math and reading scores. In Module 4, we took in data from our provided resources and performed functions upon the data to take a deeper look into the numbers. From there, we inserted the data into data frames which allows them to be presented in an easy-to-read chart. This allows us to see the data broken down further to show us trends and draw conclusions.

Conclusions

A very obvious conclusion we can draw is that students do not perform as well in district schools as they do in charter schools. This is more apparent in math than reading. Accordingly, district schools only pass 53.7% of their students compared to charter schools which graduate 90.4% of theirs. That is a drop off of almost 38%. The data tells us that charter schools perform much better than district schools. This trend is very similar when comparing the overall passing percentages of small/medium schools to large schools.

Another conclusion that we can draw is that more money spent per student does not necessarily mean better performance. This is illustrated by comparing the amount of money spent at the lowest performing school to the highest performing school. The lowest performing school, Figeroua High School, spends $639 per student while the highest performing school, Cabrera High School, spends $582 per student.
